        <h3 class="h3grid">Antonio Gaudi</h3>
        <p class="p-grid">The voices of Barcelona blur in a mix of Spanish and Catalan in much the way Gaudi's work blurs the lines between architecture and artwork.

        <p class="p2-grid"> the tiled benches in Guell Park to the towers over Casa Mila and Casa Battl칩, I fell in love with Goudi's work on my first trip to Barcelona.

        <h3 class="h3grid">Park Guell</h3>
        <p class="p-grid">The benches as Lizard fountain in Park Guell make up part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site know as, "The Works of Antonio Gaudi."</p>
        <p class="p2-grid">The park features Gaudi's famous Lizard Fountain, as well as benches and other extraordinary examples of Gaudi's talent with tiles.</p>

        <h3 class="h3grid">Casa Batll칩</h3>
        <p class="p-grid">The first time I strolled down the Passeig de Gr치cia (Catalan for the Promenade of Grace), I stopped in my tracks in front of Gaudi's Casa Batll칩.</p>
        <p class="p2-grid">The 'house,' wedged between two 'normal' buildings, looks more like a giant sculpture than any house I'd ever seen anywhere else.</p>

    <div class="sectiongrid">
        <h3 class="h3grid">Casa Mila</h3>
        <p class="p-grid">A popular attraction in Barcelona, Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera, is arguably one of the most famous buildings designed by Gaudi.</p>
        <p class="p2-grid">The roof features a collection of chimneys and towers that like they'd fit right in as characters in a Dr. Suess book.</p>
